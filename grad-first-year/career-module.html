            <h5>Global Professional Preparation Academy (GPPA)</h5>
            <p class="lead text-justify">We know many of you are already interested in getting a job on campus, therefore the ISSC has developed the Global Professional Preparation Academy, better known as the GPPA.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">The GPPA is a semester-long series for first-year international students to build their professional portfolios through workshops hosted by the ISSC, <a target="_blank" href="https://career.asu.edu/" class="asu-link">Career and Professional Development Services</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/" class="asu-link">W.P. Carey School of Business</a>.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">The GPPA is designed and structured to aid students in achieving both academic and career success through trainings that will give you the A-Z on how to create your professional profile. The GPPA will have a resume, cover letter, interview, and networking workshops, plus much more.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">The focus of this program will be to help students gain the skills needed for successfully applying to on-campus jobs, with additional support on building their long-term professional development.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">This program is designed to help our first-year international students, therefore extensive event information will be launched on the canvas resource hub starting August 16th. So please settle in and look forward to this module and all the content we will have to offer - not to mention  the workshops and events!</p>
