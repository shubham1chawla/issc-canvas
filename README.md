The following sections discuss how to create and manage Canvas courses.

### Uploading files to Canvas

![Canvas Files Tab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e88c24d-3212-47b3-a590-d2870a4b01fc)

1. Navigate to the Canvas course's `files` section. The URL for it will be `https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/<COURSE_ID>/files`.
2. Create new folders to organize the content based on the file type.

> [!NOTE]
> Previous Canvas courses had a folder called `html` for `.html` and `.css` files. For images, they had a folder called `images`.

3. Once in the folder, you can upload multiple files that need to be in that folder.

![Publish Button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc5de266-2f47-46b6-b206-b8d6fbf70896)

![Set visibility to Public](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388d4e27-9ba1-48bf-be80-d81d4077cca4)

4. By default, the files will have the visibility set to `Inherit from Course`; change it to `Public` to allow Canvas app users to access them.
5. You can now use this file in the Canvas course using its ID.
6. To retrieve the file ID, click on the uploaded file, and it will open it in a pop-up preview. The number following `preview=` in the URL is the file ID.
